    <p>Zabuza ended the conversation with his hiding in mist technique, summoning a thick veil of mist from the nearby lake in order to hide himself from the sharingan. He later appears to give naruto some advice (since haku was wearing a mask during their first encounter, naruto didn&#039;t recognize him), and then again at the arc&#039;s climactic battle on the bridge, where he engages naruto and sasuke while zabuza faces down kakashi (and poor sakura, uh, looks on helplessly, since she&#039;s stuck shielding tazuna). The land of waves arc is the second arc of the series that follows naruto on his first real mission that puts him against zabuza momochi and haku of the hidden mist. The kyuubi, the sharingan, and the raikiri could all be easily introduced in the parts where they were seen in other arcs. Before the term of the fourth mizukage, yagura karatachi, kirigakure began the practice of pitting kirigakure.</p>
